        <p class="body-default">
          A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a healthy
          weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim
          for a nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables.
          Additionally, strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for five days a week.

          Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not suited for every person. Specific
          groups should carefully consider their BMI outcomes, and in certain cases, the measurement may not be
          beneficial to use.

          The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary with age. Consequently, a child's age and
